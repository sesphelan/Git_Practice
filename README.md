####A Brief Overview####

The article gives a brief summary of a researcher's work in Guangzhou, China in the area of medical AI. So far, the scientist has used
medical records from over 1.3 million patient visits to develop and train an AI to diagnose children's illnesses. Some of the 
illnesses tested include influenza, chicken pox, and hand-foot-mouth disease.

According to him, his program might work better than some real-life doctors. He says:

>When you’re busy you can see 80 patients a day. And you can only grasp so much information. That’s where we potentially as human physicians might make mistakes. AI doesn’t have to sleep, it has a large memory and doesn’t lose energy.

####My Opinion####

I selected this article because I believe it showcases the positive uses of AI while still being weary of overusing it, or relying too much
upon it. The article explains that this form of technology could indeed have several positive implications for global health in the
near future, but by removing the human element from this industry, it will eventually decrease our understanding of the subject which
would lead to a complete dependence on technology.

In my opinion, technologies like this need to be used in moderation, as an aiding tool to a human doctor. With automation comes a
great risk that will be hard to undo.
